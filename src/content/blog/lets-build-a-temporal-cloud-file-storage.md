Some time ago, I wanted to share some SSH keys between my devices so that I would be able to log in into my GitHub account. At that time, I didn't find any trusted and secure service because I neither knew how to search for one nor found someone whom I would trust enough.

Later on, I discovered some good and free-to-use services, as well as paid options. Those services have insteresting features which we will explore within this post. Recently, I wanted to start with Supabase, so it's time for another project.

Allow me to introduce to you my temporary file share service.
